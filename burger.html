        A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of
        fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically 
        beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. 
        <br>
        The name "hamburger" comes from the seaport town of Hamburg,
        Germany, where it is thought that 19th-century sailors 
        brought back the idea of raw shredded beef 
        after trading with the Baltic provinces of Russia.
