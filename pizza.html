        Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
        flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, 
        cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then 
        baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
        A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
