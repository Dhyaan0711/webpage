        Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of 
        the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, 
        and usually some type of meat or in some cases without any meat, 
        and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.
        <br>
        Biryani is a symbol of a country that takes differences
        and divergences and then merges them into one India. Every
        Indian knows that dal is not a single dish. Yes, it is always
        made from lentils but that
        is about all the various dals of India have in common.
