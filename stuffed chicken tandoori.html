        Tandoori chicken is a South Asian dish of chicken marinated 
        in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a cylindrical
        clay oven. The dish is now popular world-wide. The modern 
        form of the dish was popularized by the Moti Mahal restaurant
        in New Delhi in the late 1940s
