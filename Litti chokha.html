    <p>Litti Chokha is a healthy combination because it does not have 
        too much cooking oil added to it. Both are either roasted or baked.
        Of course, desi ghee adds to its calories but you can choose
        to avoid it or use a little bit of it. 
        Also, pure desi ghee comes with its own set of health benefits 
        unlike your refined oils
        <br>
        Herbs and spices used to flavour the litti include 
        onion, garlic, ginger, coriander leaves, lime juice,
        carom seeds, nigella seeds and salt. Tasty pickles 
        can also be used to add spice flavour.
